# Current Affairs Notes - April 2025

### Events

*   **Justice Verma Controversy and Judicial Inquiry**
    *   On **March 14, 2025**, Chief Justice of India (CJI) **Sanjiv Khanna** ordered an **in-house inquiry** into Delhi High Court Judge **Justice Yashwant Varma**. This decision followed the alleged discovery of **large sums of unaccounted cash** at his official residence after a fire broke out.
    *   Justice Varma denied knowledge of the cash.
    *   The Supreme Court Collegium, in an extraordinary meeting, formed a **three-member committee** consisting of Justice Sheel Nagu (Chief Justice of Punjab & Haryana High Court), Justice G.S. Sandhawalia (Chief Justice of Himachal Pradesh High Court), and Justice Anu Sivaraman (Judge of Karnataka High Court).
    *   A transfer of Justice Varma to his parent High Court in Allahabad was proposed as an administrative response.
    *   The in-house enquiry mechanism was formally recognized in **1995** following the case of *C. Ravichandran Iyer v. Justice A.M. Bhattacharjee*, addressing a gap where misconduct did not meet the threshold for impeachment. The procedure was revised in **2014** after *Additional District Judge 'X' v. Registrar General, MP HC*, establishing a **seven-step framework** for greater clarity and consistency.
    *   The seven steps involve a complaint to the CJI, preliminary assessment, formation of a three-member inquiry committee, adherence to natural justice, a comprehensive report, and subsequent advisory, recommendation for resignation, or initiation of formal removal proceedings.
    *   Judicial impeachment under Article 124(4) requires "proved misbehaviour" or "incapacity" and a two-thirds majority in both Houses of Parliament. Past impeachment proceedings against judges in India have mostly been inconclusive.

*   **Parliament Hikes MPs Salary and 8th Pay Commission**
    *   On **March 25, 2025**, the Central Government notified a **24% hike** in the salaries and pensions of Members of Parliament (MPs), effective **April 1, 2023**.
    *   This increase is based on the **Cost Inflation Index**.
    *   Key details of the hike include: a monthly salary increase for MPs from ₹1 lakh to **₹1.24 lakh**, daily allowance from ₹2,000 to **₹2,500**, and monthly pension for former MPs from ₹25,000 to **₹31,000**.
    *   The **Finance Act, 2018**, introduced an automatic revision mechanism linking MPs' salaries to the Cost Inflation Index every five years, eliminating the need for fresh legislation for every adjustment.
    *   The Union Government has also approved the formation of the **8th Pay Commission**, which is expected to benefit approximately **4.5 million central government employees** and **6.8 million pensioners**.
    *   The 8th Pay Commission's primary objective is to propose revisions to Dearness Allowance (DA) and Dearness Relief (DR), using data from the Consumer Price Index for Industrial Workers (CPI-IW). The Chairperson is typically a retired Supreme Court judge, and the commission usually submits its report within 18 to 24 months.

*   **X Files a Case Against Union Government and Sahyog Portal**
    *   In **April 2025**, X (formerly Twitter) filed a lawsuit against the Union Government in the Karnataka High Court concerning the **SAHYOG portal**.
    *   X alleges that the SAHYOG portal functions as a "censorship portal" that bypasses legal safeguards under Section 69A of the Information Technology (IT) Act and violates free expression rights.
    *   The case questions whether Section 79(3)(b) of the IT Act can be used to issue information-blocking orders, which X argues is not authorized by law.
    *   The **Sahyog Portal**, launched in **October 2024** by the **Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA)** under the Indian Cyber Crime Coordination Centre (I4C), aims to streamline the reporting and removal of unlawful online content. It allows over **7,400 authorized government officials** to directly flag and request content takedown, bypassing judicial scrutiny.
    *   X's internal analysis suggests that approximately **30% of takedown requests** pertain to criticism of Union Ministers or government decisions, indicating potential political targeting.
    *   The Government maintains that Section 79(3)(b) is a compliance mechanism, and the SAHYOG portal is merely a notification tool. Major intermediaries like Google and Meta have onboarded to the portal.
    *   X seeks a declaration that Section 79(3)(b) does not empower the government to issue blocking orders, invalidation of all notices issued via SAHYOG under this section, a temporary stay on its enforcement, and judicial affirmation that Section 69A remains the sole legal provision for content blocking, with due process as per *Shreya Singhal v. Union of India (2015)*.

*   **Rising Concerns over Section 44(3) of New Data Protection Law Weakening RTI Act**
    *   Congress leader **Jairam Ramesh** and several activists have urged the repeal of **Section 44(3) of the Digital Personal Data Protection (DPDP) Act, 2023**.
    *   This section amends **Section 8(1)(j) of the Right to Information (RTI) Act**, broadening the exemption for personal information that can be withheld from the public.
    *   Previously, Section 8(1)(j) allowed withholding personal information only if its release was not in the public interest or if it caused an unwarranted invasion of privacy. The amendment under Section 44(3) now simplifies this by stating that personal information can be **automatically withheld**, removing the public interest clause.
    *   Activists fear this change will drastically limit public access to information about public servants, allowing government agencies to hide crucial data under the guise of privacy. They note that the Supreme Court’s *K.S. Puttaswamy judgment (2017)*, which recognized the right to privacy, never recommended amending the RTI Act.
    *   The Government, through Minister Ashwini Vaishnaw, defended the amendment, stating it aims to harmonize privacy with the right to information and prevent misuse of personal data, while asserting that information like public officials' salaries would remain accessible.
    *   The RTI Act is derived from fundamental rights under Articles 19(1)(a) and 21 of the Constitution. The DPDP Act, 2023, was passed by Parliament in August 2023, based on the recommendations of the **B.N. Srikrishna Committee**.

*   **Supreme Court Order on Tamil Nadu Governor Issue**
    *   On **April 8, 2025**, the Supreme Court of India issued a landmark judgment, declaring Tamil Nadu Governor **R.N. Ravi’s prolonged refusal to assent to 10 state bills as illegal and unconstitutional**.
    *   The Court provided **time-bound guidelines for Governors** under Article 200 of the Constitution and referenced the historical power tussle between Dr. Rajendra Prasad and the Nehru government over the Hindu Code Bill to underscore constitutional boundaries.
    *   The judgment stated that the Governor's conduct lacked good faith and was deliberately obstructive, invoking **Article 142** to deem the 10 Bills as having received assent due to the extensive delays.
    *   The guidelines mandate the Governor to grant assent or reserve a bill within **1 month** (if on advice), return a bill within **3 months** (if against advice), reserve a bill within **3 months** (if against advice), and assent after reconsideration within **1 month**.
    *   The ruling emphasized that the Governor's role is that of a constitutional figurehead and not a political agent, and re-passed bills must be assented to, unless there are substantial reasons for reservation for the President. This interpretation is grounded in previous cases like *Nabam Rebia (2016)* and the *2023 Punjab ruling*.

*   **26/11 Conspirator Tahawwur Rana Extradited**
    *   On **April 10, 2025**, **Tahawwur Hussain Rana**, a key conspirator in the **2008 Mumbai terror attacks (26/11)**, was extradited from the United States to India after years of legal proceedings.
    *   Rana, a former Pakistani military doctor and Canadian citizen, was convicted in the US in 2011 for providing material support to Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) but was acquitted of charges directly related to the Mumbai attacks.
    *   David Headley, the main planner of the 26/11 attacks, stated that Rana aided his reconnaissance missions in India and provided logistical support.
    *   US President Donald Trump approved Rana's extradition in February 2025. The US Supreme Court upheld lower court decisions in January 2025, rejecting Rana's appeals.
    *   Rana's legal team invoked "double jeopardy," but US courts ruled that the charges in India were distinct from those adjudicated in the US, meeting the "dual criminality" requirement of the **India–United States Extradition Treaty (1997)**.
    *   In India, Rana faces charges under the Indian Penal Code (IPC) and the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA). The National Investigation Agency (NIA) had filed a chargesheet against him in 2011. His trial will commence in India at the NIA Special Court in Delhi.

*   **Parliament Passes Waqf Amendment Bill**
    *   On **April 4, 2025**, the **Waqf (Amendment) Bill, 2025**, also known as the **UMEED Act**, was passed in the Rajya Sabha.
    *   The Act aims to modernize the management and governance of Waqf properties by amending the previous Waqf Act, 1995.
    *   Key provisions of the UMEED Act include:
        *   **Renaming** the Act to UMEED (Unified Management, Empowerment, Efficiency, and Development).
        *   **Inclusion of non-Muslim members** in Waqf boards at both central and state levels to promote inclusivity, a provision met with opposition concerns about infringing Article 26(b).
        *   **Elimination of the ‘Waqf by User’** provision, which allowed properties to be declared Waqf based on historical use, though already registered properties retain their status.
        *   Reinstatement of the requirement that only **practicing Muslims of at least five years** can dedicate property to Waqf, which critics argue violates Article 25.
        *   **Removal of Section 40**, which granted sweeping powers to Waqf Boards to designate any property as Waqf land.
        *   Protection of **inheritance rights for women and children**.
        *   Prohibition of Waqf establishment on **tribal lands** under Schedules V and VI of the Constitution.
        *   Mandatory **digital registration** of all Waqf properties on a centralized portal within six months to enhance transparency.
    *   Changes in Waqf management include a senior government official having final authority in dispute resolution instead of Waqf Tribunals, and, for the first time, allowing **appeals against Waqf Tribunal decisions to the High Court**. Financial reforms include reducing the mandatory contribution to Waqf boards from 7% to **5%** and government audits for institutions generating over ₹1 lakh annually.

*   **Telangana Becomes First State to Notify Categorisation of Scheduled Castes**
    *   On **April 14, 2025**, **Telangana** became the **first Indian state** to implement the sub-categorisation of Scheduled Castes (SCs) through the enactment of the **Telangana Scheduled Castes (Rationalisation of Reservations) Act, 2025**.
    *   The Act, which received the Governor’s assent on April 8, 2025, formally divides SCs into three sub-groups for reservations in public employment and education, effective from April 14, 2025.
    *   This policy follows the Supreme Court’s landmark judgment in *State of Punjab v. Davinder Singh (2024)*, where a Constitution Bench upheld the constitutional validity of further sub-classification within SC and ST categories.
    *   The **Shamim Akhtar Commission** recommended this three-tier classification, which is based on socio-economic, educational, political, and employment status.
    *   The categorisation provides: **Group I (1% reservation)** for 15 most backward sub-castes; **Group II (9% reservation)** for 18 sub-castes with marginal benefits; and **Group III (5% reservation)** for 26 sub-castes with relatively better opportunities.
    *   The Supreme Court in *Davinder Singh (2024)* overruled its earlier decision in *E.V. Chinnaiah v. State of Andhra Pradesh (2004)*, which had held SCs as a homogeneous class that could not be sub-classified by states without a parliamentary amendment to the Presidential list under Article 341. The Court affirmed that sub-categorisation is constitutionally valid if based on empirical data and rational criteria, and is permissible as an instrument of affirmative action under Articles 15(4), 15(5), and 16(4).

*   **Tamil Nadu Forms Committee to Review Centre-State Relation Under Justice Kurian Joseph**
    *   On **April 15, 2025**, Tamil Nadu Chief Minister **M.K. Stalin** announced the formation of a high-level committee aimed at strengthening state autonomy and improving Centre-State relations.
    *   The committee is headed by former Supreme Court judge **Justice Kurian Joseph** and includes Ashok Vardhan Shetty (former IAS officer) and M. Naganathan (former vice-chairman of Tamil Nadu’s Planning Commission).
    *   Its mandate includes reviewing constitutional provisions, laws, and policies related to Centre-State relations, proposing the restoration of subjects moved from the State List to the Concurrent List, recommending administrative reforms, and enhancing cooperative federalism.
    *   The committee is expected to submit an interim report by **January 2026** and a final report within **two years**.
    *   This initiative coincides with the golden jubilee of the **State Autonomy Resolution passed by the Tamil Nadu Legislative Assembly in 1974** and draws parallels with the 1969 **Rajamannar Committee**, which also studied state autonomy and recommended the repeal of Article 356.
    *   Tamil Nadu’s grievances include the imposition of the NEET exam overriding state education policies, financial autonomy concerns (receiving only **29 paise for every rupee** contributed to the Union), significant revenue loss due to GST, and concerns over delimitation (2026) potentially reducing parliamentary representation due to successful population control.

*   **Bhagavad Gita and Natyashastra Added to UNESCO’s Memory of the World Register**
    *   On **April 17, 2025**, UNESCO inscribed manuscripts of the **Bhagavad Gita** and **Bharata’s Natyashastra** on its **Memory of the World Register**.
    *   This marks a significant international recognition of India’s civilisational wisdom and artistic tradition, with Prime Minister Narendra Modi hailing it as a "proud moment for every Indian".
    *   The **UNESCO Memory of the World Programme**, launched in **1992**, aims to preserve humanity’s documentary heritage and prevent "collective amnesia". The Register is updated biennially.
    *   With these additions, India now has **14 inscriptions** on the Register, including the Rig Veda (2005), Abhinavagupta’s collected works (2023), and the Non-Aligned Movement Summit archives (2023).
    *   The **Natyashastra**, traditionally attributed to Bharata Muni (c. 2nd century BCE), is a Sanskrit treatise foundational to Indian performing arts, known for its exposition of ‘rasa’ (aesthetic essence).
    *   The **Bhagavad Gita**, attributed to Vyasa (c. 1st or 2nd century BCE) and part of the Mahabharata (Bhishma Parva), is a philosophical dialogue between Arjuna and Krishna on duty, righteousness, and spiritual wisdom.
    *   Both manuscripts are preserved at the **Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute, Pune**.

*   **Mehul Choksi Arrested in Belgium: India Seeks Extradition**
    *   On **April 12, 2025**, fugitive diamond merchant **Mehul Choksi** was detained by **Belgian authorities in Antwerp** following an extradition request from India.
    *   Choksi is a prime accused in the **₹13,000 crore Punjab National Bank (PNB) loan fraud case**, which was unearthed in 2018.
    *   The fraud involved the illegal issuance of Letters of Undertaking (LoUs) and Foreign Letters of Credit (FLCs) by officials of PNB’s Brady House branch in Mumbai, benefiting firms owned by Choksi and Nirav Modi. These LoUs were not backed by collateral and were not entered into the bank's core banking system, leading to a loss of ₹6,344.97 crore for PNB.
    *   Choksi, who had been residing in Antigua and Barbuda after fleeing India in 2018, was located in Belgium where he had arrived for medical treatment in November 2023.
    *   A Belgian court rejected Choksi’s bail plea on April 23, 2025, citing health grounds. His legal team claimed the case was politically motivated and cited poor prison conditions in India.
    *   The extradition is based on the **India–Belgium Extradition Treaty**, with a new treaty approved in **March 2020** adopting a "dual criminality" approach.

*   **Pahalgam Terror Attack and India-Pakistan Tensions**
    *   On **April 22, 2025**, a terrorist attack occurred in **Baisaran Valley, near Pahalgam, Anantnag district, Jammu and Kashmir**, resulting in the deaths of **26 individuals** (25 Indian nationals, 1 Nepalese tourist) and over 20 injured.
    *   **The Resistance Front (TRF)**, an offshoot of Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT), initially claimed responsibility but later retracted. Indian intelligence identified **Saifullah Kasuri (alias Khalid)**, a top LeT commander, as the mastermind.
    *   Prime Minister Narendra Modi, after cutting short his visit to Saudi Arabia, convened a meeting of the **Cabinet Committee on Security (CCS)**.
    *   The CCS, on **April 23, 2025**, announced several punitive actions against Pakistan:
        *   **Suspension of the Indus Waters Treaty (IWT)**, a first since its inception in 1960.
        *   **Closure of the Integrated Check Post at Attari**, halting all bilateral land border movement.
        *   Withdrawal of **SAARC Visa Exemption Scheme (SVES)** benefits for Pakistani nationals.
        *   Declaration of Pakistani High Commission's Defence, Naval, and Air Advisors as **persona non grata**.

*   **Aurangzeb & Maratha Empire Controversy (Protests in Nagpur)**
    *   In **March 2025**, violent protests erupted in **Nagpur, Maharashtra**, driven by renewed demands from right-wing groups for the **removal of Mughal Emperor Aurangzeb’s tomb in Khuldabad**.
    *   The agitation was reportedly sparked by the public response to the historical film "**Chhaava**," which depicts the torture and execution of **Chhatrapati Sambhaji Maharaj by Aurangzeb**.
    *   Aurangzeb, who reigned from 1658 to 1707, is a controversial figure in Indian history, known for expanding the Mughal Empire to its greatest extent but also for his orthodox Islamic policies, including the re-imposition of the **jizya tax** on non-Muslims and the destruction of Hindu temples. His simple, unadorned tomb in Khuldabad, near Aurangabad, has become a symbolic site in ongoing historical and political debates.

*   **New Chola Inscription Discovered near Madurai’s Melavalavu**
    *   A new **Chola inscription** has been discovered on **Somagiri Hills at Melavalavu**, near Melur in **Madurai district**, shedding light on the reign of **Rajaraja Chola** in the Pandya region.
    *   Dating back to around **1000 CE**, this discovery is considered significant by historians due to its rare reference to Rajaraja Chola in the Pandya country.
    *   Key findings from the inscription include the honorific title "**Raja Raja Mummudichola**," indicating the Chola-Pandya relationship. It details the military conquest of the Pandya region by **Viranarana Pallavarayan**, a commander under Rajaraja Chola.
    *   The inscription also mentions **Malaiyappa Sambu**, who hewed steps to a temple, and refers to a bronze idol of **Lord Muruga** that was relocated to a nearby village temple.
    *   The discovery was made during a field study by Thamizhthaasan of the Madurai Nature Cultural Foundation and Professor P. Devi Arivu Selvam, with C. Santhalingam of the Pandya Nadu Centre for Historical Research playing a key role in deciphering it.

    *   On **March 13, 2025**, the Haryana government officially declared two Harappan civilization sites—**Mitathal and Tighrana in Bhiwani district**—as **protected archaeological monuments**.
    *   This measure aims to safeguard these over 4,400-year-old settlements from encroachment and damage, under the Haryana Ancient and Historical Monuments and Archaeological Sites and Remains Act, 1964.
    *   **Mitathal**, first discovered in 1913, revealed artifacts from the Copper-Bronze Age culture (3rd–2nd millennia BCE), reflecting Harappan town planning, architecture, and crafts. Notable finds include pottery with pipal leaf designs and various artifacts made from terracotta, stone, and copper.
    *   **Tighrana**, dating back to around 2,400 BCE, was inhabited by Chalcolithic agricultural communities known as Sothians. It represents a transition from the Harappan to the Post-Harappan period, featuring mud-brick houses, wheel-made ceramics, and advanced tools.
    *   These sites are crucial for understanding the evolution of early human settlements in the region and provide a unique chronological sequence from Pre-Siswal, Pre-Harappan, to Post-Harappan periods.

### International Affairs

*   **Tension over Geopolitics in Arctic**
    *   Tensions in the Arctic region have escalated due to melting sea ice, which has opened access to untapped resources (13% of world's undiscovered oil and 30% of untapped natural gas) and new maritime trade routes, such as the Northern Sea Route (NSR).
    *   The **Arctic Council**, comprising eight states (United States, Iceland, Norway, Sweden, Russia, Greenland/Denmark, Finland, and Canada), is the leading intergovernmental forum for Arctic cooperation, established on **September 19, 1996**, via the Ottawa Declaration. **Norway** holds the current chairmanship for 2023-2025.
    *   **Russia** has heavily militarized its Arctic territories, establishing ballistic missile submarines and nuclear warhead storage facilities in the Kola Peninsula, and maintaining the world’s largest fleet of icebreakers. Russia's 2035 Arctic Strategy aims to exploit resources and enhance military presence along the NSR, which is also being developed for trade with Asia.
    *   **NATO** is concerned, with a focus on the GIUK gap (Greenland-Iceland-U.K.) as a critical naval choke point. New security infrastructure includes:
        *   The upgraded **Early Warning Radar (UEWR)** at Pituffik Space Base (Greenland) by the U.S. for missile defense and space surveillance.
        *   A new air surveillance radar on Sornfelli Peak in the Faroe Islands (Denmark) to monitor North Atlantic airspace.
        *   Deployment of U.S. Navy **P-8A Poseidon aircraft** at Naval Air Station Keflavik (Iceland) for Anti-Submarine Warfare (ASW).
        *   NATO’s Joint Expeditionary Force (JEF) initiated "**Nordic Warden**," a UK-led mission to protect critical undersea infrastructure and monitor maritime threats in Northern Europe.
    *   The **Northwest Passage (NWP)** remains a key flashpoint, with **Canada** asserting it as internal waters (full sovereignty) and the **U.S.** contending it as an international strait (right of transit passage). Despite the 1988 Arctic Cooperation Agreement, the legal dispute is unresolved.
    *   **China** views itself as a "Near-Arctic State" (policy released in 2018), with research facilities (Arctic Yellow River Station in Svalbard) and an expanding icebreaker fleet (Xue Long 1 & 2). China has significant investments in Russia's Arctic energy projects (Yamal LNG, Arctic LNG 2) and is developing a "Polar Silk Road" with Russia, linking to its Belt and Road Initiative (BRI).
    *   **India's interests** include energy security, protecting monsoon patterns, and counterbalancing China's influence. India signed the Svalbard Treaty in 1920, established its research station **Himadri** in Svalbard, Norway, and formalized its Arctic Policy in 2022 with six key pillars covering scientific, economic, transportation, governance, cooperation, and human welfare aspects. India also cooperates with Russia on Arctic energy projects and is developing the Chennai-Vladivostok Eastern Maritime Corridor.

*   **USA Liberation Day Tariffs**
    *   On **April 2, 2025**, U.S. President Donald Trump declared a national emergency, invoking the **International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) of 1977**, to introduce "Liberation Day" tariffs.
    *   This new tariff regime imposed a **10% universal tariff on all imports** into the United States, effective April 5, 2025. Additionally, country-specific "reciprocal" tariffs, ranging from 11% to 50%, were levied on imports from 57 countries with trade surpluses with the U.S., becoming effective April 9, 2025, but suspended for 90 days for all countries except China.
    *   These actions intensified the **China-USA Trade War**, with China retaliating by increasing tariffs on American goods from 84% to 125%, and the U.S. imposing up to 245% on Chinese imports.
    *   The tensions are driven by the U.S. trade deficit with China (USD 295 billion in 2024), allegations of intellectual property theft, efforts to diversify supply chains (e.g., through the **India-US COMPACT Initiative**), and geopolitical rivalry. The WTO warns that a full-blown trade war could slash global GDP by up to **7%**.
    *   For **India**, the U.S. remains its **largest trading partner**, with a trade surplus of **US$36.8 billion in FY24**. India was assigned a **26% tariff rate** under the new regime, which is estimated to impact up to **87% of India's exports to the U.S.**, valued at approximately $66 billion, particularly affecting pharmaceuticals and automotive exports. However, the U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods may create export opportunities for Indian sectors like textiles and leather.

*   **WHO Concludes Negotiations on Pandemic Agreement**
