## Polity & Governance

### Government Initiatives & Policy Changes

*   **Uttarakhand Implements Uniform Civil Code (UCC)**
    *   **First state** in India to implement UCC, effective from **January 27, 2025**.
    *   Aims to standardise personal civil laws, ensuring **equal rights and responsibilities** for all citizens, irrespective of religion.
    *   **Key Features**: Harmonises laws for marriage, divorce, inheritance, and property rights across communities, with the **exception of Scheduled Tribes**. Ensures **gender equality** by granting equal property and inheritance rights, and prohibiting practices like halala, iddat, talaq, and polygamy. Sets legal marriage age at **21 years for men and 18 years for women**. Mandates **registration for all marriages, divorces, and live-in relationships** within prescribed deadlines (e.g., new marriages within 60 days) on an **official UCC online portal**.
    *   **Historical Context**: The concept of UCC was first discussed during the Constituent Assembly in the 1940s, with **Article 44** of the Indian Constitution (Directive Principles of State Policy) stating that "The State shall endeavor to secure for the citizens a uniform civil code throughout the territory of India".
    *   **Related Committees & Cases**:
        *   **Shah Bano Case (1985)**: Supreme Court ruled in favour of a Muslim woman seeking maintenance, intensifying the UCC debate.
        *   **Sabhajit Singh Committee (1986)**: Concluded UCC could not be implemented immediately due to India's diversity.
        *   **Law Commission of India (2018)**: Recommended a phased introduction of UCC with public awareness campaigns due to complexities of religious diversity and public opinion.
        *   **Ranjana Desai Committee (2022)**: Formed by the Uttarakhand government to draft the state's UCC, which was passed by the Uttarakhand Assembly in early 2024.
        *   **Triple Talaq Case (Shayara Bano v. Union of India, 2017)**: Supreme Court declared triple talaq unconstitutional, which garnered widespread support for UCC, especially from gender equality proponents.
*   **Government Plans to Amend Nuclear Liability Law**
    *   The Indian government plans to amend the **Civil Liability for Nuclear Damage Act (CLNDA)** and the **Atomic Energy Act**.
    *   This policy shift aims to **revive stalled nuclear power projects** with France’s Electricite de France (EDF) and the U.S.-based Westinghouse Electric Company (WEC) by addressing legal concerns that have deterred foreign investments.
    *   **Background**: India’s 2010 nuclear liability laws imposed strict liability on nuclear suppliers, which contrasted with international norms like the Convention on Supplementary Compensation for Nuclear Damage (CSC), ratified by India in 2016, where operators are primarily accountable. Previous government stance in 2015 ruled out amendments, and a ₹1,500 crore insurance pool in 2019 failed to attract major contracts.
    *   **Affected Projects**: Jaitapur Nuclear Project (Maharashtra) with EDF (six EPR1650 reactors) and Kovvada Nuclear Project (Andhra Pradesh) with Westinghouse (six AP1000 reactors).
    *   **Future Goals**: The government has allocated **₹20,000 crore for five Small Modular Reactors (SMRs)** to be operational by **2033**, with a target of **100 GW nuclear power capacity by 2047**.
    *   This move aims to **strengthen strategic partnerships** with the U.S. and France and facilitate the long-pending **U.S.-India Civil Nuclear Agreement (2008)**.
*   **Ban on Begging in Bhopal**
    *   Following Indore's example, **Bhopal has implemented a complete ban on begging** in public places, labelling it a social menace.
    *   The ban prohibits begging at traffic signals, intersections, religious sites, and tourist attractions, and also **forbids giving alms or purchasing goods from beggars**.
    *   **Legal Framework**: Implemented under **Section 163 of the Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita (BNSS), 2023**, which grants executive magistrates power to prohibit nuisances.
    *   **Penalties**: Under **Section 223 of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita (BNS), 2023**, standard offenses carry up to six months imprisonment, a ₹2,500 fine, or both. If public safety is endangered, punishment increases to one year imprisonment and a ₹5,000 fine.
    *   **Government Initiatives**: The **SMILE Scheme (2022)**, launched by the Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment, aims for rehabilitation through medical care, education, and skill training, striving for a "beggar-free" India by 2026.
    *   **Judicial Precedents**:
        *   **Delhi High Court (2018)**: Struck down parts of the Bombay Prevention of Begging Act as arbitrary and violative of Article 21 (Right to Life and Dignity).
        *   **Supreme Court of India (2021)**: Rejected a PIL to remove beggars, stating begging is a socio-economic issue, not a criminal offense.
*   **NBFCs Not Under Writ Jurisdiction: SC**
    *   The Supreme Court ruled that **private companies, including NBFCs and scheduled banks, are not subject to writ jurisdiction** as they do not perform public functions or duties.
    *   NBFCs are not classified as "State" under **Article 12**.
    *   Writs are legal orders issued under **Articles 32 (Supreme Court) and 226 (High Courts)** to enforce Fundamental Rights.
*   **AnSI Proposed Inclusion of 179 Communities into SC, ST and OBC**
    *   A three-year ethnographic study by the **Anthropological Survey of India (AnSI)** and Tribal Research Institutes (TRIs) categorized **268 denotified, semi-nomadic, and nomadic tribes**.
    *   The study recommends **179 communities** for inclusion in Scheduled Castes (SC), Scheduled Tribes (ST), and Other Backward Classes (OBC) lists across 26 states and UTs. Specifically, **46 for OBC, 29 for SC, and 10 for ST**.
    *   **Uttar Pradesh** has the highest number of recommended inclusions (19 communities).
*   **One Nation, One Time Initiative**
    *   The Indian government introduced this initiative to **mandate the use of Indian Standard Time (IST)** across all sectors for uniform and precise timekeeping.
    *   The **Legal Metrology (Indian Standard Time) Rules, 2025**, aim to synchronize communication networks, public services, and critical infrastructure.
    *   India will replace reliance on foreign GPS satellites with its indigenous **NavIC system** for time synchronization.
*   **President’s Rule Imposed in Manipur**
    *   President’s Rule was imposed in **Manipur on February 15, 2025**, following the resignation of Chief Minister N Biren Singh on February 9, 2025.
    *   This marks the **11th instance** of President’s Rule in Manipur, making it one of the states where it has been used most frequently.
    *   **Constitutional Provisions**: **Article 356** empowers the President to impose direct Central rule if a state’s governance cannot proceed per constitutional provisions, usually based on the Governor's report. **Article 365** triggers President's Rule if a state fails to comply with Union directives.
    *   **Implications**: State's executive powers vest in the President and are delegated to the Governor. The State legislative assembly may be dissolved or placed in suspended animation. The judiciary remains unaffected.
    *   **Procedure**: Proclamation must be ratified by both Houses of Parliament within **two months**. It remains effective for **six months**, extendable up to a **maximum of three years** with parliamentary consent. Extensions beyond one year require a national emergency or Election Commission confirmation of election infeasibility.
    *   **Important Judgements**:
        *   **S.R. Bommai v. Union of India (1994)**: Laid down guidelines to prevent misuse of Article 356, mandating floor tests, judicial review of imposition, and secularism as a criterion for dismissal.
        *   **State of Rajasthan v. Union of India (1977)**: Held that President's satisfaction under Article 356 is subject to judicial review, but with limited scope.
        *   **Rameshwar Prasad v. Union of India (2006)**: Declared dissolution of Bihar assembly unconstitutional due to conjecture-based Governor's report.
    *   **Significant Committees**:
        *   **Sarkaria Commission (1983)**: Recommended sparing use of Article 356, prior warning, and parliamentary approval for assembly dissolution.
        *   **National Commission to Review the Working of the Constitution (NCRWC) (2000)**: Advised sparing use of Article 356 as a last resort and its continuation without emergency if elections are unfeasible.
        *   **Punchhi Commission (2007)**: Proposed amending Articles 355 and 356 for localized President’s Rule (max three months) and a detailed, objective Governor's report.
*   **Supreme Court Stays Lokpal Order on High Court Judges**
    *   The Supreme Court stayed a Lokpal order that classified **High Court judges as ‘public servants’** under the Lokpal and Lokayuktas Act, 2013, which would allow the anti-corruption body to investigate them.
    *   A Special Bench of Justices B.R. Gavai, Surya Kant, and A.S. Oka found the Lokpal's interpretation "very disturbing" and affecting **judicial independence**.
    *   The Lokpal, led by former Supreme Court Justice **A.M. Khanwilkar**, had entertained complaints alleging misconduct by a sitting High Court judge.
    *   The Lokpal argued High Court judges fall under Section 14(1)(f) of the 2013 Act because many High Courts were established under British rule and later recognised under the Indian Constitution, thus considered institutions by an Act of Parliament.
    *   However, the Lokpal had previously excluded Supreme Court judges from its jurisdiction, stating the Supreme Court was created solely by the Constitution (Article 124) and not an Act of Parliament.
    *   **Legal Reference**: **K. Veeraswami v. Union of India (1991)** case held that judges are "public servants" under the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988, but require **prior sanction from the Chief Justice of India (CJI)** for investigation.
    *   The case will be heard on **March 18, 2025**.
*   **Chhattisgarh High Court Ruling on Marital Rape**
    *   The Chhattisgarh High Court quashed a husband's conviction for rape and unnatural sex with his wife, citing the **marital rape exception** and doubts over evidence.
    *   The judgment referenced the Supreme Court’s decision in **Navtej Singh Johar vs Union of India (2018)**, which decriminalised homosexuality under Section 377 but did not impact the marital rape exception.
    *   **Committees' Views**:
        *   **Law Commission of India (2000)**: Expressed reservations about criminalising marital rape, citing "excessive interference with the institution of marriage".
        *   **Justice J.S. Verma Committee (2013)**: Advocated for the **deletion of the marital rape exception** from Section 375 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC), stating it was rooted in outdated notions of a wife's irrevocable consent.
        *   **Parliamentary Standing Committee on Home Affairs (2013)**: Opposed criminalisation, reasoning it could destabilise family structure and existing laws (Section 498A IPC, Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act, 2005) were adequate.
*   **Obscenity Laws in India: Recent YouTube Controversy**
    *   YouTuber Ranveer Allahbadia is under legal scrutiny for allegedly making obscene remarks on his show ‘India’s Got Latent’.
    *   **Assam Police** lodged a complaint under **Section 296 of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita (BNS), 2023**. Mumbai Police initiated investigation.
    *   **Obscenity Definition**: Under **Section 294 of the BNS, 2023**, obscene content is defined as "lascivious, appeals to the prurient interest, or tends to deprave and corrupt".
    *   **Online Obscenity**: **Information Technology Act, 2000 (Section 67)**, applies to online obscenity.
    *   **Key Cases on Obscenity**:
        *   **Ranjit D. Udeshi v. State of Maharashtra (1964)**: Supreme Court upheld conviction for selling 'Lady Chatterley's Lover', applying the English **Hicklin Test** ("deprave and corrupt susceptible minds").
        *   **Bobby Art International v. Om Pal Singh Hoon (1996)**: Court ruled film 'Bandit Queen's explicit scenes were essential to portray reality and not obscene in context.
        *   **Aveek Sarkar v. State of West Bengal (2014)**: Supreme Court shifted from Hicklin Test to the **'community standards' test**, assessing obscenity based on contemporary societal norms and overall context.
        *   **Supreme Court Ruling on ‘College Romance’ (March 2024)**: Quashed charges, clarifying that **foul language alone does not constitute obscenity** unless it arouses lustful thoughts; reinforced context-based assessments.
*   **Delhi Election and Evolution of Delhi Administration - LG Issue**
    *   **BJP MLA Rekha Gupta** sworn in as the **ninth Chief Minister of Delhi** on **February 20, 2025**, at Ramlila Maidan, New Delhi.
    *   This marks the **first BJP government in Delhi in 26 years** and ends the **Aam Aadmi Party's (AAP) decade-long rule**.
    *   **2025 Delhi Legislative Assembly Election Outcome**: BJP secured 48 seats (52.4% vote share), AAP secured 22 seats (43.57% vote share), and INC won no seats.
    *   **Power Dynamics between LG and CM**:
        *   **Constitution (Sixty-ninth Amendment) Act, 1991**: Granted Delhi special status as NCT, creating Legislative Assembly and Council of Ministers, but LG retained discretionary powers.
        *   **Delhi High Court (2016)**: Ruled that the LG held supremacy in administrative matters of the NCT.
        *   **Supreme Court's Balancing Act (2018, NCT of Delhi v. Union of India)**: Clarified LG must act on the aid and advice of the Council of Ministers for matters within legislative competence, but retained right to refer matters to President in case of disagreement. LG should not act as an "obstructionist".
        *   **Government of NCT of Delhi (Amendment) Act, 2021**: Redefined "government" in Delhi to mean the LG, enhancing LG's authority.
        *   **Supreme Court's Affirmation (May 2023)**: Ruled Delhi government possesses legislative and executive control over services, **excluding public order, police, and land**.
        *   **Central Government's Ordinance (May 2023)** & **Government of NCT of Delhi (Amendment) Act, 2023**: Established the **National Capital Civil Services Authority** (CM, Chief Secretary, Principal Home Secretary), but granted LG final say in transfers/postings of Group 'A' officers, effectively solidifying LG's control.
