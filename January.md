*   **Court’s Interpretation**: The Transgender Persons Act, 2019, as a **special law, takes precedence over the 1969 Act (general law)**, applying the principle “**generalia specialibus non-derogant**” [111, 112, 114, 115].

    *   **Certificate of Identity**: Application with affidavit to DM; issued within **30 days** [120-123].

*   **Bifurcation of Andhra Pradesh and Telangana**: The Court clarified that laws made by undivided Andhra Pradesh (including general consent) continue to apply to both states unless altered [158-160].

    *   Priya’s only option is to seek **blood money (diyya)** from the victim’s family [336-340].
*   **Blood Money Definition**: Under **Islamic law (Sharia law)**, the victim’s family has the option to **pardon the murderer in exchange for monetary compensation (diyya)**, as outlined in the Quran (Surah 2:178) [340-344]. The amount is typically decided through negotiation between families [340, 345].
*   **Indian Government Assistance**: Extending all possible assistance to secure her release [336, 338, 339, 346, 347].
*   **Background**: Nimisha Priya moved to Yemen in 2008 [338, 339, 348]. She and her husband Tomy Thomas started a clinic with local partner Talal Abdo Mehdi [338, 339, 348].

*   **Pardoning Mechanisms (India vs. Yemen)**:
    *   **Yemen**: Blood money (diyya) as per Sharia law; victim’s family or court-appointed body has authority to pardon; forgiveness in exchange for blood money; strongly linked to Islamic law [341-344].
    *   **India**: **Article 72 of the Constitution** grants the President power to grant pardons; based on mercy petitions; pardoning is secular, with no religious basis [341, 342, 344, 350].
