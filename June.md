# Current Affairs Notes - June 2025

## Polity & Governance

### Space Activities Bill & Tamil Nadu Space Industrial Policy

*   **Draft Space Activities Bill Finalised (May 2025)**
    *   The Government of India finalised the new draft of the Space Activities Bill 2025.
    *   **Aim**: Grant statutory powers to **IN-SPACe** (Indian National Space Promotion and Authorisation Centre) and enable greater private sector participation in India's space sector.
    *   **Vision**: To develop a **$44 billion space economy by 2033**, up from $8.4 billion in 2022.
    *   **Background**: The first draft was circulated in 2017 but never introduced in Parliament. IN-SPACe was established in 2020, and the Indian Space Policy 2023 was released to define roles for public and private players.
    *   **Key Highlights of the Bill**:
        *   Provides legal authority to IN-SPACe to authorise, monitor, and regulate non-governmental space activities, ending case-by-case approvals.
        *   Includes a framework for **licensing, compliance, penalties, and insurance**.
        *   Introduces provision for **affordable insurance** for space assets and activities, addressing a concern for startups.
        *   Updates punitive clauses: imprisonment up to three years and fines over ₹1 crore for violations (e.g., launching without a license, false information, polluting space), making them more industry-friendly.
        *   Revises clauses on **Intellectual Property Rights (IPRs)** created in outer space, which previously vested rights with the government.
    *   **Legal Implications**: Provides statutory legitimacy to India’s regulatory mechanism, fulfilling obligations under international space treaties such as the **Outer Space Treaty (1967), Rescue Agreement (1968), Liability Convention (1972), and Registration Convention (1975)**. It defines liabilities, responsibilities, and obligations of private players and safeguards sovereign interests.
    *   **Economic Significance**: Expected to unlock large-scale domestic and foreign investments, encourage new-age space startups (launch vehicles, satellite systems, data services), and act as a catalyst for private capital inflow, technological innovation, and global competitiveness. Exports alone are expected to contribute **$11 billion** by 2033.
    *   **Technological Innovation**: Focus on small satellites, reusable launch vehicles, in-space refuelling/manufacturing, and multi-payload data fusion.
    *   **Consultation Process**: The draft bill will undergo internal and inter-ministerial consultations, public feedback, then submitted to the Prime Minister and Union Cabinet before Parliament.

*   **Tamil Nadu Space Industrial Policy 2025 Approved (April 17, 2025)**
    *   Approved by the Tamil Nadu Cabinet, chaired by Chief Minister **M.K. Stalin**.
    *   **Aim**: To attract **₹10,000 crore in investments** and generate **10,000 new jobs** in the state’s space technology sector over the next five years.
    *   **Background**: Formulated after the Indian Space Policy 2023 opened the space sector to private participation and encouraged state-level initiatives.
    *   **Existing Infrastructure**: Tamil Nadu houses the ISRO Propulsion Complex (IPRC) in Mahendragiri, Tirunelveli (for cryogenic and storable propellant engine testing), and the Space Technology Incubation Centre (STIC) at NIT Tiruchirappalli.
    *   **Upcoming Infrastructure**: A new spaceport at Kulasekarapattinam in Thoothukudi district is designed to support small satellite launches.
    *   **Key Highlights of the Policy**:
        *   Proposed **‘Space Bay’** across four southern districts: **Madurai, Thoothukudi, Tirunelveli, and Virudhunagar**, inspired by Florida’s Space Coast.
        *   Encourages startups with annual turnover below ₹25 crore through dedicated financial support and relaxed investment thresholds.
        *   Agnibaan, India’s first 3D-printed rocket developed by IIT Madras-incubated Agnikul Cosmos, was cited as a model for future startup success.
        *   Projects below ₹300 crore receive structured incentive packages; larger investments qualify for special structured support under Tamil Nadu’s Industrial Policy for Sunrise Sectors.
    *   **Government Policies (Incentives)**:
        *   **Reimbursement**: Up to **50%** of the cost incurred on securing patents, trademarks, copyrights, and geographical indications.
        *   **Payroll Subsidy**: For companies conducting R&D or establishing Global Capability Centres (GCCs) in the space sector within the state.
        *   **Industrial Housing Incentive**: Developers of space industrial parks receive a 10% incentive on residential facilities, capped at ₹10 crore over 10 years.
        *   **Capital Subsidy**: 25% (capped at ₹5 crore) for firms undertaking green and sustainable initiatives.
        *   **MoU**: Signed between TIDCO and IN-SPACe to facilitate industrial-scale manufacturing, design, and service development for space missions.
    *   **Legal Implications**: Aligned with the Indian Space Policy 2023, which permits participation of Non-Governmental Entities (NGEs) under IN-SPACe. Tamil Nadu is the **third state**, after Karnataka and Gujarat, to formulate a State Space Policy.
    *   **Economic Significance**: Expected to boost Tamil Nadu’s GSDP, leveraging existing industrial ecosystem in precision manufacturing, advanced electronics, and space-grade components. Over 250 local vendors are already part of the ISRO supply chain.

### Killing of Basava Raju and the History of Naxalite Movement

*   **Nambala Keshava Rao alias Basavaraju Killed (May 21, 2025)**
    *   **Event**: Security forces killed **Basavaraju**, the General Secretary of CPI (Maoist), along with 27 other Maoists during an anti-Naxal operation in **Abujhmad, Narayanpur district, Chhattisgarh**.
    *   **Significance**: Union Home Minister **Amit Shah** hailed it as a landmark achievement in India’s battle against Left-Wing Extremism (LWE) and reiterated the Centre’s target of eliminating Maoism by **March 2026**. Security analysts believe this could mark the beginning of the end for the armed Maoist movement.
    *   **Who was Basavaraju?**:
        *   Born July 10, 1955, in Jiyanapeta village, Srikakulam, Andhra Pradesh.
        *   Trained engineer (B.Tech from Regional Engineering College, Warangal) and a national-level volleyball player.
        *   Joined People’s War Group (PWG) in the early 1980s.
        *   Succeeded Mupalla Laxman Rao alias Ganapathy as General Secretary of the CPI (Maoist) in 2017 (announced 2018).
        *   **Role**: Commander-in-Chief of the Central Military Commission (CMC) of the CPI (Maoist), handling operations, intelligence, recruitment, and ambushes. Also a Politburo member, Central Committee member, Standing Committee member, and on the Editorial Board of the Maoist publication *Awam-e-Jung*.
        *   Known as a **military strategist** for planning lethal Maoist attacks and accepting civilian casualties as "collateral damage".
        *   Listed in India’s most-wanted list with a **reward of ₹2.02 crore** on his head. He is the **third member of the CPI (Maoist) Central Committee** to be killed in 2025 (after Prayag Manjhi and Chalapathi).
    *   **Notorious Operations Under Basavaraju**:
        *   **2013 Latehar (Jharkhand)**: IED planted inside the body of a dead CRPF jawan, killing rescue personnel.
        *   **2018 Sukma IED blast (Chhattisgarh)**: Killed 9 CRPF personnel.
        *   **2019 Gadchiroli landmine blast (Maharashtra)**: Killed 15 police personnel and one driver.
        *   **2021 Sukma-Bijapur ambush (Chhattisgarh)**: Killed 22 security personnel and injured 32.
        *   **2023 Dantewada IED blast**: Killed 10 DRG personnel and 1 civilian.
        *   **2025 Bijapur IED attack**: Killed 8 DRG personnel and a civilian driver.
    *   **Counter-Insurgency Operations**:
        *   Chhattisgarh Police, along with District Reserve Guards (DRG) and other central agencies, intensified operations in Abujhmad, Dantewada, and Bijapur, supported by real-time intelligence.
        *   The operation that killed Basavaraju followed 21 days of targeted intelligence and field surveillance.
        *   **Recent Maoist Losses (Dec 1, 2023, to May 20, 2025, in Chhattisgarh)**: 401 Maoists killed, 1,355 surrendered, 199 encounters, 516 weapons seized.
        *   **Government Strategy**: The Centre’s **“Clear-Hold-Develop” strategy** blends security operations, infrastructure development, and rehabilitation.
    *   **Impact**: Basavaraju’s death creates a leadership vacuum and weakens the insurgency’s command and control structure, likely demoralising lower cadres. The movement has been pushed back to a few remaining pockets, primarily in Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand, Odisha, and Maharashtra, from its earlier spread across the "Red Corridor".

### First Women Batch Graduates from NDA

*   **Landmark Event (May 29–30, 2025)**
    *   The **first-ever batch of 17 female cadets** graduated as part of the **148th National Defence Academy (NDA) Course**.
    *   The Passing Out Parade (POP) was held at Khetarpal Ground, Pune.
    *   **Reviewing Officer**: General (Dr) V.K. Singh (Retd), Governor of Mizoram.
    *   **NDA**: Established in 1954 at Khadakwasla, Pune (Maharashtra), it is the **first tri-service academy in the world**, jointly training cadets for the Indian Army, Navy, and Air Force. It offers undergraduate degrees (B.Sc., B.A., B.Tech.) awarded by Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU), Delhi.
    *   **Supreme Court Mandate (2021)**: Directed the Union Public Service Commission (UPSC) to allow women to appear for the NDA examination, paving the way for admission of women cadets from 2022 onwards.
    *   **Legal Implications**: This integration aligns with constitutional protections under **Article 14 (Right to Equality), Article 15 (Prohibition of discrimination on grounds of sex), and Article 16 (Equality of opportunity in public employment)**. It sets a legal precedent for further inclusion of women in combat roles, training institutions, and strategic leadership positions within the Armed Forces.
    *   **Awards**:
        *   **President’s Gold Medal**: Battalion Cadet Adjutant Prince Raj.
        *   **President’s Silver Medal**: Academy Cadet Captain Udayveer Singh Negi.

    *   The parade concluded with a grand **flypast ceremony** involving Chetak helicopters, Super Dimona gliders, and Sukhoi-30 fighter jets.

### India’s EV Localisation Policy

*   **New Policy Unveiled (June 2025)**
    *   The Government of India unveiled the **Scheme to Promote Manufacturing of Electric Passenger Cars in India (SPMEPCI)**.
    *   **Aim**: To boost domestic EV manufacturing, attract foreign investment, and support India’s green energy transition.
    *   **Key Provision**: Significant **customs duty concessions** for foreign electric vehicle (EV) manufacturers, provided they commit to local investment and value addition.
    *   **Exclusions**: Major global firms like **Tesla opted out**, and **Chinese EV manufacturers have been excluded** due to national security concerns. BYD and Great Wall Motors proposals were rejected in 2023.
    *   **Import Duty Concessions**:
        *   Reduction in customs duty on Completely Built Units (CBUs) of electric cars from 70–100% to **15%** for vehicles priced above **$35,000** (approx. ₹29.75 lakh).
        *   Benefits apply for a **5-year period** from application approval.
        *   Manufacturers can import up to **8,000 units per year**, with unused quotas carried over.
        *   Total customs duty benefit is capped at **₹6,484 crore** or the actual investment made, whichever is lower.
    *   **Investment and Localisation Requirements**:
        *   Eligible manufacturers must invest a minimum of **₹4,150 crore within three years**.
        *   **Local Value Addition (LVA)**: 25% by Year 3 and 50% by Year 5.
        *   **Turnover Thresholds**: ₹2,500 crore in Year 2, ₹5,000 crore in Year 4, ₹7,500 crore in Year 5.
        *   Applicants must have global group revenue of ₹10,000 crore (₹3,000 crore for investment firms).
        *   The application window remains open for 120 days, extendable until March 15, 2026.
    *   **Key Stakeholders**: Mercedes-Benz, Volkswagen-Skoda, Hyundai, and Kia have shown interest.
    *   **Strategic Vision**: Promote clean mobility, position India as a global EV manufacturing hub, reduce import dependency, and achieve climate targets under India’s **Net-Zero 2070** pledge.
    *   **Previous Policy Landscape**: Earlier efforts like FAME I & II and the PLI Scheme for ACC batteries focused on subsidising domestic players in 2W, 3W, and commercial segments. This new policy shifts focus to **premium electric four-wheelers**.
    *   **Legal Implications**: The scheme includes enforceable conditions, and import concessions can be revoked for non-compliance. National security concerns are cited for denying access to Chinese EV companies. The government also clarified that dumping or circumvention of trade norms will not be tolerated, in line with anti-dumping and FDI norms under FEMA and DPIIT guidelines.
    *   **Economic Significance**: Expected to create high-skill jobs in manufacturing, assembly, and R&D, and drive investment inflows, especially in battery production and EV supply chains. However, domestic OEMs like Tata Motors and Mahindra have expressed concerns that foreign imports at concessional rates could undermine local production.
    *   **International Relations and Trade**: Ongoing trade negotiations with the US, UK, and EU may complicate tariff structures. India has agreed under the UK FTA to reduce car import duties to 10% under quota, though small EVs remain exempt.

### Supreme Court Reinstates Three-Year Practice Rule for Judicial Services

*   **Landmark Decision (May 20, 2025)**
    *   The Supreme Court of India reinstated the **three-year minimum practice requirement** for law graduates seeking entry into judicial services.
    *   This reverses the 2002 relaxation that had allowed fresh law graduates to directly apply for judicial posts.
    *   **Bench**: Headed by Chief Justice **B. R. Gavai** along with Justices A. G. Masih and K. Vinod Chandran.
    *   **Court’s Reasoning**: First-hand courtroom experience is indispensable and cannot be substituted by academic learning or pre-service training alone. Judges need deep practical insight to handle matters relating to life, liberty, property, and reputation from day one. Theoretical knowledge and pre-service training are insufficient substitutes for real courtroom dynamics.
    *   **Specific Directions Issued by the Court**: All state governments and High Courts are directed to amend their judicial service recruitment rules to incorporate:
        *   **Minimum Three Years of Practice**: Every applicant for the Civil Judge (Junior Division) examination must have at least three years of continuous legal practice, calculated from the date of enrolment with a State Bar Council.
        *   **Inclusion of Law Clerkship Experience**: Candidates who have worked as law clerks or research assistants under judges may count this period toward the three-year requirement.
        *   **Certification Requirement**: A certificate attesting to the candidate’s practice must be issued by an advocate with not less than 10 years of standing at the Bar, and endorsed by a competent judicial officer. For Supreme Court or High Court practitioners, endorsement must come from a judge or registrar.
        *   **Mandatory Pre-Posting Training**: Even after selection, judicial officers must undergo a minimum of one year of pre-service judicial training before being entrusted with independent judicial functions.
    *   **Legal and Constitutional Considerations**: Critics argue that this rule change could infringe on **Article 14 (equality before law)** and **Article 19(1)(g) (freedom of profession)**, especially as no transition period was offered for aspirants already preparing under the earlier framework.
    *   **Constitutional and Legal Framework**: Articles 233 to 237 govern the subordinate judiciary.
        *   **Article 233**: Appointment of District Judges by the Governor in consultation with the High Court.
        *   **Article 234**: Recruitment of other judicial officers below District Judge rank.
        *   **Article 235**: Vests control over the subordinate judiciary with the High Courts.
    *   **Direct Recruitment (Entry-Level Judicial Services)**: Conducted through State Judicial Service Examinations. Eligibility includes Indian citizenship, LL.B., age limit, and now, enrolment with the Bar Council.
    *   **Lateral Entry (Higher Judicial Service)**: Advocates with seven years of practice are eligible for direct recruitment to District Judge posts (Article 233(2)).

### The Veeraswami Case Revisited: Call for Judicial Accountability

*   **Vice President Jagdeep Dhankhar** criticised the in-house inquiry into **Justice Yashwant Varma**, insisting it lacks legal sanctity without a formal FIR.
*   He argued that the **1991 K. Veeraswami judgment**, which mandates prior sanction before prosecuting judges, has become a "scaffolding of impunity", and urged its re-examination.
*   The controversy stemmed from a fire on March 14–15, after which half-burnt cash was found in Justice Varma’s residence, with the incident delayed in disclosure by over a week.
*   A three-judge Supreme Court panel, convened by **CJI Khanna**, deemed the allegations credible and recommended possible impeachment.

### Enrolment Drop in Government Schools & PM-POSHAN Concerns

*   ABSS, launched in 2023, aims to revamp over 1,300 railway stations in phases, focusing on modern facilities, sustainability, and cultural heritage integration.

### Telangana Notifies Kumram Bheem Conservation Reserve

*   **Telangana** declared **Kumram Bheem Conservation Reserve** under **Section 36(A) of the Wildlife (Protection) Act, 1972**.
*   **Purpose**: To connect the **Kawal and Tadoba Tiger Reserves**, strengthening a critical tiger corridor across Telangana, Maharashtra, and Chhattisgarh.
*   The reserve covers 1,492.88 sq. km and spans 78 forest blocks.
*   A 12-member Conservation Reserve Management Committee was constituted, including DFOs, NGOs, local panchayat leaders, and government officers.

### India to Conduct Population Census 2027 with Caste Enumeration

*   The Government of India announced that the next national population census will be conducted in **two phases**, beginning in **April 2026** and concluding by **March 1, 2027**.
*   The census will include comprehensive **caste enumeration**, collecting data on SCs, STs, OBCs, and General category castes for the **first time since 1931**.
*   **Phase I (House Listing)**: April to September 2026.
*   **Phase II (Population Enumeration)**: February 2027 (with October 1, 2026, as the reference date for snow-bound areas).

*   The system prevents duplication, provides real-time dashboards, and supports monthly district-level reviews.
*   It aligns with **PM Gati Shakti** and **Gram Manchitra** schemes. All projects from 2020 to 2025 must be registered by March 31, 2026.

### India Sets New Temperature Norms for ACs

*   The government revised national guidelines for air conditioner operations, mandating a temperature band of **20 °C to 28 °C** for all new residential, commercial, and vehicular AC units.
*   This builds on the 2018 advisory, which recommended 24 °C as default.
*   **Expected Benefits**: 6% energy savings per degree increase, reduce grid stress during heatwaves, save ₹18,000–₹20,000 crore in electricity bills over three years, and reduce peak load demand by 60 GW by 2035.
*   A parallel **₹5,400 crore fund** has been launched to support 30 GWh battery storage projects.
*   For the first time, **vehicle-installed ACs and non-residential cooling systems** have been included under central energy-efficiency regulations.

### Centre’s Spending Cap on MGNREGS Faces Criticism

*   The Finance Ministry capped **MGNREGS expenditure at 60% of the ₹86,000 crore annual budget** for April–September FY26.
*   **Aim**: To control chronic overspending, address pending dues (∼₹22,462 crore), and promote fiscal discipline.
*   **Criticism**: This move contradicts the scheme’s demand-driven statutory nature and undermines legal guarantees under the MGNREG Act, 2005, with precedents like *Swaraj Abhiyan v. Union of India (2016)* affirming that funds cannot override rights. Critics warn it may lead to denial of work or wage delays and erode the scheme’s purpose as a rural safety net.

### India Notifies Inter-Services Organisations Rules, 2025

*   The Indian government notified the **Inter-Services Organisations (Command, Control and Discipline) Rules, 2025**.
*   These rules were framed under the **Inter-Services Organisations Act, 2023**, which came into force on **May 10, 2024**.
*   **Aim**: To improve **joint command and discipline** within the Armed Forces.
*   It grants Commanders-in-Chief and Officers-in-Command of Inter-Services Organisations (ISOs) authority over Army, Navy, and Air Force personnel under their command.
*   The rules lay down protocols for succession in command, designation of officiating officers, and emergency command appointments to maintain operational efficiency.
*   This reform aims to achieve **jointness, efficiency, and cohesion** across India's tri-service military operations.

## Economy & Governance

### Net FDI Falls 96% in 2024-25

*   **RBI Report (FY 2024-25)**
    *   India’s **net Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) sharply declined by 96%** to **USD 353 million** in FY 2024-25, compared to USD 10.1 billion in the previous year.
    *   **Reasons for decline**: Primarily driven by a surge in **repatriation of funds by foreign companies** and a significant increase in **Outward FDI (OFDI) by Indian companies**.
    *   **Gross FDI**: Remained robust, rising to **USD 81 billion**, indicating sustained interest in India's economic fundamentals.
    *   **Net FDI Calculation**: Gross inflows minus profit remittances, equity sell-downs, and overseas investments of domestic firms.
*   **Key RBI Findings for FY 2024-25**:
    *   More than 60% of gross inflows were channelled into manufacturing, financial services, electricity and other energy, and communication services.
    *   **Top Recipient Sectors of FDI equity**: Services sector (19% of total inflows, rising sharply by 40.77% to $9.35 billion), followed by computer software and hardware (16%) and trading (8%).
    *   FDI into manufacturing increased 18% to $19.04 billion.
    *   **Top States for FDI Equity Inflows**: Maharashtra (39%), Karnataka (13%), and Delhi (12%).
    *   Manufacturing inflows were concentrated in Gujarat, Tamil Nadu, and Karnataka (transport equipment, pharmaceuticals, electronics).
    *   India attracted **$748.78 billion in FDI over the past 11 years (2014–2025)**, a 143% increase compared to the previous 11-year period (2003–2014).
*   **Top-Five Source Countries for Inward FDI**:
    *   **Singapore**: India’s single-largest source for the seventh successive year, sending approximately **US $14.9 billion** (about 30% of all equity inflows, 27% annual growth).
    *   **Mauritius**: Second-largest investor (over US $8 billion).
    *   **United States**: Third-ranked (about US $5.5 billion).
    *   **Netherlands**: Fourth-ranked (close to US $4.6 billion).
    *   **United Arab Emirates (UAE)**: Fifth-ranked (estimated US $4.3 billion).
    *   These five collectively supplied over three-quarters of all gross FDI to India in FY 2024-25.
*   **India’s Outward-FDI (OFDI) Story in FY 2024-25**:
    *   Indian companies deployed a **record US $29.2 billion abroad**, around 75% more than the US $16.7 billion recorded in FY 2023-24.
    *   **Key sectors**: Financial services, banking and insurance, manufacturing, and wholesale trade.
    *   **Top-Five Destinations for OFDI**: Singapore (top, springboard for acquisitions across ASEAN), United States (second, Indian buy-outs in renewable energy, semiconductors), UAE (third, Gulf logistics parks), Mauritius (fourth, Africa-facing financial vehicles), Netherlands (fifth, European base for green energy/EV battery supply chain acquisitions).

### GDP Base Year Revised to 2022-23

*   **Announcement (February 27, 2026)**
    *   The Government of India will revise the **GDP base year to 2022–23**, with the new series to be released on February 27, 2026.
    *   This will mark India’s **eighth GDP base year revision**, replacing the current 2011–12 series.
    *   The **Index of Industrial Production (IIP)** and **Consumer Price Index (CPI)** base years will also be updated.
    *   **Significance**: Ensuring statistical accuracy and restoring credibility after the missed 2017–18 update and growing concerns over data integrity and transparency.
*   **Understanding GDP Base Year**: Acts as a benchmark year to compare real economic growth by adjusting for inflation and changes in sectoral composition. Revisions are necessary as the economy evolves, new sectors emerge, and better data sources become available.
*   **Why Revise to 2022–23?**
    *   To reflect the **post-pandemic economic reality**, including shifts in healthcare, digital services, gig economy, and formalisation due to GST and PLI schemes.
    *   The planned 2017–18 revision was dropped due to data quality concerns in the Consumer Expenditure Survey (CES) and Periodic Labour Force Survey (PLFS), along with disruptions from demonetisation (2016) and Goods and Services Tax (GST) rollout (2017).
    *   COVID-19 further delayed revisions, as subsequent years were deemed economically abnormal.
*   **Importance of GDP Base Year Revisions**:
    *   **Capturing Structural Changes**: India’s economy has undergone a sectoral shift, with the services sector now contributing ∼55% to GDP.
    *   **Data Modernisation**: Incorporates new data sources like MCA-21 corporate filings, GST records, and improved surveys from NSSO and PLFS.
    *   **Accurate Real Growth**: Updates price weights and industry baskets to eliminate inflationary distortions.
    *   **Inclusion of New Sectors**: Incorporates new economic activities like digital platforms, solar energy, and telemedicine.
    *   **Better Policy and Investment Planning**: Supports informed decisions in public finance, monetary policy, and private sector investment.
    *   **Global Reputation**: International bodies like IMF, World Bank, and credit rating agencies depend on credible GDP data.
*   **Historical Context**: First national income estimates in 1951 by National Income Committee (P.C. Mahalanobis). Base years revised seven times, most recently from 2004–05 to 2011–12 in January 2015.
*   **Challenges and Controversies (2015 Revision)**: Criticised for methodological concerns (MCA-21 data over-representing large firms, excluding informal units), credibility questions (former Chief Economic Advisor Arvind Subramanian questioned estimates). India uses single deflation instead of double deflation, which is especially important in manufacturing. The 2018 back series revision faced political backlash for appearing to lower UPA-era growth rates.
*   **Global Relevance**: The new GDP series is crucial as India is on the cusp of becoming the **third-largest economy in nominal terms**, behind only the US and China.

### Industrial Growth Slows to Eight-Month Low of 2.7% in April 2025

*   India’s **Index of Industrial Production (IIP)** grew by only **2.7% in April 2025**, the lowest in eight months.
*   This slowdown was largely due to a decline in mining output and sluggish growth in electricity and consumer non-durables.
*   Manufacturing grew by 3.4%, with strong gains in machinery (17.0%), automobiles (15.4%), and basic metals (4.9%), while mining contracted by 0.2%.

### RBI Annual Report 2024–25

*   India’s real GDP growth slowed to **6.5% in FY25** (from 9.2%), but still retained its position as the fastest-growing major economy, with inflation easing to 4.6%.
*   The RBI's net income surged by **27.5% to ₹2.69 lakh crore**, enabling a record surplus transfer to the government. The Contingency Risk Buffer (CRB) was set at 6% ±1.5%.
*   The RBI’s balance sheet expanded by 8.2% to ₹76.25 lakh crore, driven by significant growth in gold holdings (52.09%) and domestic investments (14.32%).
*   The **₹2, ₹5, and ₹2000 notes were discontinued**, with the ₹500 note dominating circulation.
*   **Digital rupee (e₹) usage** rose by 334% to ₹1,016.5 crore.
*   Digital payment innovations like ‘UPI Circle’ and enhanced UPI Lite transaction limits were introduced.

### RBI Announces 55th Monetary Policy Committee Meeting Decisions (June 2025)

*   The RBI's Monetary Policy Committee cut the **repo rate by 50 basis points to 5.50%**, marking the third rate cut in 2025.
*   The **Cash Reserve Ratio (CRR)** was reduced by **100 basis points to 3%**, phased in four stages beginning September 2025, potentially injecting ₹2.5 lakh crore into the economy.
*   The RBI changed its stance from 'accommodative' to **'neutral'**, signalling a more balanced approach to growth and inflation management.
*   CPI inflation for FY26 was revised down to 3.7%, with GDP growth maintained at 6.5%.

### India’s Extreme Poverty Rate Falls to 5.3% (World Bank Report 2025)

*   The World Bank reported on June 7–8, 2025, that India’s extreme poverty rate dropped from 27.1% (2011–12) to **5.3% (2022–23)**.
*   This was calculated using a revised global poverty line of **$3/day (2021 PPP)**.
*   The number of people in extreme poverty fell from 344.5 million to 75.2 million, reflecting a shift of nearly **269 million people out of extreme poverty**.

## International Affairs

### Ukraine’s ‘Operation Spider’s Web’

*   **Drone Offensive (May 2025)**
    *   Ukraine launched **“Operation Spider’s Web”**, a technologically sophisticated drone offensive that penetrated deep into Russian territory.
    *   **Targets**: Airbases more than 4,000 km from the frontline, resulting in the destruction of over **40 strategic Russian aircraft**, including Tu-95, Tu-160, and A-50 planes.
    *   **Damage**: Inflicted an estimated **$7 billion** in damage, marking a turning point in the Ukraine-Russia conflict.
    *   **Shift in Strategy**: Traditionally, Ukraine used long-range drones from its own territory. In this operation, **short-range, AI-powered drones were smuggled inside decoy trucks**, disguised as civilian cargo, and launched from within Russia.
    *   **Tactical Supervision**: The operation was personally overseen by Ukrainian President **Volodymyr Zelensky** and Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) Chief **Vasyl Maliuk**.
    *   **Scale of Attack**: First confirmed Ukrainian strike to hit **five Russian airbases on the same day**, ranging from Murmansk in the Arctic Circle to Irkutsk near Lake Baikal (700-2500 km from Ukraine).
    *   **Aircraft Struck**: At least 41 aircraft were struck, including Tu-95MS, Tu-22M3, and a rare A-50 AEW&C. Western intelligence assessed 10-13 bombers destroyed, while Kyiv claimed up to 20. Independent imagery confirmed burnt-out aircraft at Olenya, Dyagilevo, and Belaya, eliminating roughly **8% of Russia’s strategic bomber inventory**. A probable hit on an A-50 Mainstay airborne-radar jet at Ivanovo would be the second such loss, reducing Russia’s fleet of these high-value assets to single digits.
    *   **Strategic Aim**: To degrade Russia’s bomber fleet that launches Kh-101/KH-555 cruise-missile salvos at Ukrainian cities, buying Kyiv breathing space and signalling escalation dominance.
    *   **Operational Concept**: Swarm attacks with **first-person-view (FPV) kamikaze drones** delivered by small sleeper cells near each base.
    *   **Airbases Targeted**: Olenya (Murmansk), Dyagilevo (Ryazan), Ivanovo-Severnyy (Ivanovo), Belaya (Irkutsk), and Ukrainka (Amur).
    *   **Command & Control**: Encrypted Starlink links fed real-time video to an SBU fusion cell in Kyiv; jamming mitigation relied on frequency-hopping algorithms.
    *   **Logistics & Deception**: Around 150 small strike drones, modular launch systems, and 300 explosive payloads were covertly smuggled into Russia, hidden inside wooden modular cabins loaded on regular cargo trucks. Unaware Russian truck drivers were used to transport disguised mobile drone launchers. At prearranged times, cabin roofs were remotely opened, and drones were launched directly from the trucks, minimising launch-to-target distance and evading Russian air defences (Pantsir and S-300 systems). After launching, the trucks self-destructed.
    *   **Operatives**: All Ukrainian operatives were successfully exfiltrated from Russia before the drones were launched.
    *   **Ukrainian Drone Manufacturing Capacity**: Ukraine has transformed into a global test-bed and production hub for unmanned systems, scaling output from tens to hundreds of thousands of drones a month since early 2024. It has created a dedicated **Unmanned Systems Forces command**. Over 300 domestic firms are involved in a decentralised production network.

### Golden Dome Missile Defence Project (USA)

*   **Project Announcement (May 20, 2025)**
    *   U.S. President **Donald Trump** announced the selection of a design for the **‘Golden Dome’** missile defence shield.
    *   **Cost**: An ambitious **$175 billion** project.
    *   **Technology**: Integrates **space-based interceptors and sensors**.
    *   **Inspiration**: Israel’s Iron Dome and Reagan’s Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI), popularly known as “Star Wars”.
    *   **Aim**: Neutralise missile threats, including **ICBMs and hypersonic weapons**, globally and in real-time.
    *   **Leadership**: General **Michael Guetlein** of the U.S. Space Force has been appointed to lead the program.
    *   **Deployment Target**: Targeted for operational deployment by **January 2029**.
*   **Evolution of Space-Based Defence**: Ideas of orbital weapons date back to World War II and were developed during the Cold War by the U.S. and the Soviet Union. Reagan’s SDI in the 1980s aimed at a similar space-based shield but was never operational due to limitations.
*   **Modern Strategic Context**: Renewed U.S. interest driven by the rise of hypersonic and ICBM threats from rivals such as **China and Russia**. Ground-based systems like the Iron Dome are effective against short-range threats but inadequate for long-range ballistic missiles.
*   **Technological Features**: The Golden Dome will be a multi-domain shield, combining ground-based radar and interceptors, naval sensors and launch systems, and **thousands of space-based satellites for detection and interception**. It aims to intercept missiles seconds after launch, possibly during their boost phase.
*   **Funding**: An initial allocation of $25 billion has been proposed under a larger $150 billion defence package, tied to a “One Big, Beautiful Bill” in Congress.
*   **Industrial Participation**: Major defence contractors and tech firms like **SpaceX, Palantir, and Anduril** are frontrunners to develop key technologies.
*   **Comparison with Israel’s Iron Dome**:
    *   **Iron Dome**: Israeli-developed, mobile, all-weather, **short-range** air defence system. Detects, tracks, and intercepts rockets, artillery shells, mortar fire, and drones. Uses **Tamir interceptor missiles** (Mach 2.2), launched from batteries (3–4 launchers, 20 missiles each). Achieves consistently above 90% interception rate for projectiles targeting populated areas.
    *   **Golden Dome**: **Long-range (global, space-based coverage)**, targeting ICBMs, hypersonic missiles, cruise missiles, drones.
*   **Legal and Strategic Implications**: The deployment of space-based weapons revives international concerns about the **militarization of outer space**, potentially violating the **Outer Space Treaty (1967)**. It could lead to a new era of space weaponization, prompting **China, Russia**, and others to accelerate similar initiatives.

### New Non-Permanent Countries to UNSC

*   **UNGA Election (June 2025)**
    *   The UN General Assembly (UNGA) elected **five new non-permanent members** of the United Nations Security Council (UNSC) for a **two-year term (2026–2027)**.

    *   **Election Process**: Annual secret ballot by UNGA, requiring a **two-thirds majority** (≥129 votes) from the 193 UN member states.
    *   **Decision-Making**: Each member has one vote; P5 members have veto power. UNSC decisions are **binding on all UN member states** under **Articles 25 and 103** of the UN Charter.
    *   **Presidency**: Rotates monthly among the 15 members in English alphabetical order. The President for **June 2025 is Guyana**.
    *   **India's Last Presidency**: December 2022, when it chaired discussions on counter-terrorism, maritime security, and reformed multilateralism.
*   **Recent Committee Appointments (2025)**:
    *   **Pakistan**: Designated to chair the **UNSC 1988 Taliban Sanctions Committee** for 2025. Also serves as one of the three vice-chairs of the **UNSC Counter-Terrorism Committee (CTC)** for 2025–2026.
    *   **Algeria**: Serves as the Chair of the UNSC Counter-Terrorism Committee (CTC) in 2025.
    *   **CTC Vice-Chairs (2025)**: France (P5), Russia (P5), and Pakistan (non-permanent member).
*   **India’s Role and Position on UNSC Reforms**:
    *   India has served **eight times as a non-permanent member** of the UNSC (1950–1951, 1967–1968, 1972–1973, 1977–1978, 1984–1985, 1991–1992, 2011–2012, and 2021–2022), making it one of the most frequently elected.
    *   **G4 Reform Proposal**: Advocates expanding UNSC from 15 to 25 or 26 members, adding **6 new permanent members** (including **India, Japan, Germany, Brazil**, and two African countries), increasing non-permanent members, and reforming the veto mechanism.
    *   **Aims of Reforms**: Address under-representation of the Global South (Africa, Latin America, Asia), and bring greater democracy, legitimacy, and effectiveness to the UNSC.
    *   **India’s Position at IGN**: Acknowledged as a strong contender for permanent membership. India emphasizes that the current UNSC configuration, designed post-World War II, no longer reflects geopolitical realities (rise of multipolarity, growing importance of developing countries, regional powers).

### Gaza: Human Made Hunger Crisis

*   **Warning of Hunger Crisis (May 2025)**
    *   The **UN Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA)** and other humanitarian organisations warned of a **human-made hunger crisis in Gaza**, following almost three months of total blockade.
    *   **Escalation**: In Rafah, 50 Palestinians were shot and injured during a food distribution effort by the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF).
*   **IPC Report (April 2025, May 11–September 30 Projection)**
    *   Predicted catastrophic levels of food insecurity, especially in North Gaza, Gaza City, Rafah, and Deir al-Balah.
    *   **22% of the Gaza Strip’s population** (approx. 4.8 lakh people) face **Catastrophic (IPC Phase 5)** levels of food insecurity, indicating a risk of starvation and acute malnutrition.
    *   In **North Gaza, 30% of the population is in Catastrophe**, with another 60% in Emergency.
    *   Deir al-Balah and Khan Younis show over 50% of their population in Emergency, and 15–20% facing starvation.
    *   The minimum food assistance required is estimated at 500–600 aid trucks per day, but only 665 trucks entered in a recent report—a quantity deemed “a drop in the bucket” by the UN World Food Programme.
*   **Ceasefire and Blockade**: A January 19–March 18 ceasefire temporarily mitigated food insecurity. However, its collapse in March 2025, followed by a renewed Israeli blockade, led to an 11-week shutdown of food and humanitarian aid, drastically worsening conditions.
*   **International Humanitarian Law**: The starvation of civilians in Gaza is considered a breach of international humanitarian law, particularly **Article 54 of Additional Protocol I to the Geneva Conventions**, which prohibits starvation as a method of warfare. The use of food aid as political leverage violates UN humanitarian principles.
*   **Criticism of GHF and UNRWA’s Position**:
    *   The Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF) was criticised for creating centralised aid collection points, accessible only to the mobile population.
    *   UNRWA rejected GHF’s aid model as incompatible with humanitarian principles, as it excludes disabled, elderly, or injured civilians and incentivises forced displacement into unsafe “safe zones”.
    *   **Jake Wood**, GHF’s head, resigned on May 25, citing deviation from humanitarian ethics.
*   **Impact on Humanitarian Workers**: Over **400 humanitarian workers, including more than 300 UNRWA personnel, have been killed in Gaza**—the highest UN staff death toll in any conflict since 1945. Gaza has become the most dangerous zone for aid workers worldwide.
*   **UNRWA’s Current Role in Gaza**: Despite restrictions elsewhere, UNRWA remains operational in Gaza, where it is the largest humanitarian organisation with 12,000 staff. It provides logistics, aid distribution, mobile healthcare, education (through the ‘Back to Learning’ initiative), and sanitation services.
*   **Neutrality and Oversight within UNRWA**: In 2023, Israel accused 12 UNRWA staff of links to Hamas, leading to suspensions and investigations by the UN Office of Internal Oversight Services. Nine staff members were dismissed based on a balance of probabilities, though no concrete evidence was shared by Israeli authorities.
*   **India’s Possible Role**: As a leading supporter of multilateralism, India can play a critical role in upholding international humanitarian law, backing UN General Assembly and International Court of Justice (ICJ) decisions, and reasserting multilateral diplomacy.

### UNGA Declares 2026 as the International Year of the Woman Farmer

*   **Declaration (June 2025)**
    *   The United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) has declared **2026 as the International Year of the Woman Farmer**.
    *   This recognition highlights the crucial role women play in agricultural production and global food security.
    *   Backed by over **100 UN member states**, the declaration seeks to spotlight both the contributions of women farmers and the systemic challenges they face (access to land, finance, technology, decision-making power).
*   **Global and Indian Context – Women in Agriculture**
    *   Globally, women contribute to approximately 50% of food production. In developing countries, women produce 60–80% of food output.
    *   In South Asia, 39% of the agricultural workforce are women.
    *   In India, 80% of economically active women are engaged in agriculture, with ∼76.95% of women in rural India involved in farming. The feminisation of agriculture is rising due to male migration.
*   **Indian Government Policies and Initiatives for Women Farmers** (partially from mind map)
    *   **Lakhpati Didi Scheme**: Promotes rural women’s entrepreneurship through Self-Help Groups (SHGs) with credit and financial services. Under the Namo Drone Didi Initiative (2024–26), 15,000 women SHGs are targeted to be trained and equipped with drones for agri-tech services.
    *   **Mahila Kisan Yojana**: Aims to provide subsidised credit and promote self-employment opportunities in agriculture specifically for SC women farmers.
    *   **National Food Security Mission (NFSM)**: 30% of funds earmarked for women beneficiaries.
    *   **Per Drop More Crop** and **Rainfed Area Development (RAD)** schemes: 25% of the 50% earmarked for small and marginal farmers is exclusively allocated to women beneficiaries.
    *   **Rashtriya Mahila Kisan Diwas**: Celebrated annually on **October 15**.
*   **Case Study: ENACT Project in Assam**
    *   The **ENACT Project (Enhancing Climate Adaptation of Vulnerable Communities through Nature-based Solutions and Gender Transformative Approaches)** is implemented by WFP in partnership with the Government of Assam, funded by **Norway**.
    *   It empowers over 300 women farmers across 17 villages in Nagaon district, connecting them with agricultural experts via **mobile-based climate advisories**.

### UNFPA State of World Population Report 2025

*   **Report Release (June 10, 2025)**
    *   The United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) released its annual flagship publication, the **State of World Population (SOWP) Report 2025**, titled **“The Real Fertility Crisis”**.
    *   **Warning**: Millions of individuals worldwide are unable to realise their reproductive goals due to a complex web of financial, social, and health-related barriers, including in India.
    *   **Focus**: Not on population decline or explosion, but on the lack of **reproductive autonomy** and the unmet fertility aspirations of people globally. Globally, 1 in 5 people are unable to have the desired number of children.
*   **India-Specific Highlights**:
    *   India remains the **world’s most populous country**, with a projected population of **146.39 crore in 2025**, expected to peak at 170 crore in the early 2060s.
    *   India’s **Total Fertility Rate (TFR)** has declined to **1.9**, now below the replacement level of 2.1.
    *   **Fertility Gaps**: Persist across regions, income groups, and social categories. While states like **Kerala, Delhi, and Tamil Nadu** have low fertility, high TFR persists in **Bihar (3.0), Meghalaya (2.9), and Uttar Pradesh (2.7)**.
    *   **Unintended Pregnancies**: One in three Indian adults (36%) experiences unintended pregnancies.
    *   **Unfulfilled Desires**: 30% of Indian adults have unfulfilled desires to either have more or fewer children.
    *   **Barriers to Parenthood (UNFPA–YouGov survey)**: 38% cited financial limitations, 21% job insecurity, and 22% housing constraints. Women disproportionately bear the burden due to social stigma, inadequate childcare, and gendered domestic expectations.
*   **About UNFPA**:
    *   A subsidiary organ of the UNGA, operating in over 150 countries.
    *   **Established**: 1969.
    *   **Mission**: Promotes reproductive rights, gender equality, and population health.
    *   **Three Transformative Goals by 2030**:
        *   Zero unmet need for family planning.

    *   **Scoring**: Scale from 0 to 1, where 1 denotes full gender parity.
*   **Regional Context and Global Comparisons**:
    *   **South Asia**: **Bangladesh** emerged as the top performer, climbing 75 positions to rank **24th globally**, largely due to gains in political empowerment.
    *   Other South Asian countries ranked above India include **Bhutan (119), Nepal (125), and Sri Lanka (130)**.
    *   **Maldives (138)** and **Pakistan (148)** performed worse than India. Pakistan ranked lowest at 148th.
    *   **Globally Top Five**: Iceland (for 16th consecutive year), Finland, Norway, United Kingdom, and New Zealand.
    *   The global gender gap is now **68.8% closed**, the highest post-pandemic progress, but full parity is still **123 years away** at current trends.
*   **India’s Structural and Policy Progress on Gender Equality**:
    *   **Constitution (106th Amendment) Act, 2023**: Mandates **33% reservation for women** in the Lok Sabha, state legislatures, and Delhi Assembly.
    *   **Educational Initiatives**: Beti Bachao Beti Padhao and Vigyan Jyoti have boosted female enrolment, with the female Gross Enrolment Ratio in higher education rising to 46.3% in 2022–23 (from 42.5% in 2017–18).
    *   **Women’s Workforce Participation**: Improved to **41.7% in 2023–24** (from 23.3% in 2017–18), supported by schemes such as Stand-Up India, Mahila e-Haat, and Entrepreneurship and Skill Development Programme (ESSDP).
    *   **Maternal Health**: Maternal Mortality Rate (MMR) dropped from 174 (2013–15) to **97 (2018–20)**, aided by schemes like PM Matru Vandana Yojana and the National Health Mission.
    *   **Financial Inclusion**: Over 28 crore women have Jan Dhan accounts.
*   **Persistent Structural Barriers and Challenges**:
    *   **Female Literacy Rate**: According to Census 2011, it is 65%, far below the male literacy rate of 82%.
    *   **Economic Disparity**: Women spend 289 minutes per day on unpaid domestic work (thrice the time spent by men), yet their average wages remain at only 73% of male earnings. Unpaid care work by women is valued at ₹22.7 lakh crore, or 7.5% of GDP, yet remains unaccounted for.
    *   **Corporate Leadership**: Only 17% of corporate leadership roles and 20% of board positions in India are occupied by women.

### Iran-Israel Conflict 2025

*   **Escalation (June 2025)**
    *   **June 13, 2025: Operation Rising Lion (Israel)**
        *   Israel launched **“Operation Rising Lion”**, striking multiple Iranian nuclear and military facilities, including **Fordow, Natanz, Esfahan, and Tabriz research centres**.
        *   The strikes killed several senior commanders and scientists.
        *   Israeli PM Netanyahu accused Iran of taking “unprecedented steps” toward building a nuclear weapon.
    *   **Iran’s Retaliation: Operation True Promise 3**
        *   Iran retaliated with ballistic missile attacks on Israeli cities under **“Operation True Promise 3”**, targeting **Jerusalem and Tel Aviv**.
    *   **June 22, 2025: U.S. Airstrikes**
        *   U.S. President **Donald Trump** announced American airstrikes on **three nuclear sites in Iran** (Fordow, Natanz, and Isfahan), further escalating the crisis.
        *   The U.S. used stealth **B-2 bombers equipped with bunker-busting bombs**, marking its first direct military intervention in the crisis.
        *   The strikes targeted uranium enrichment facilities.
*   **Concerns**: Heightened fears of global oil supply disruptions, a diplomatic crisis, and regional instability.
*   **India’s Response**: India launched **Operation Sindhu** to evacuate its citizens from Iran.
*   **Historical Context**:
    *   **Pre-1979**: Iran was among the first Muslim-majority countries to recognise Israel post-1948, driven by mutual opposition to Arab nationalism. Under the Pahlavi dynasty, Iran maintained strong diplomatic and economic ties with Israel. Israel pursued a “Periphery Doctrine” to counter Arab hostility.
    *   **Post-1979**: The Islamic Revolution in 1979 transformed Iran into a theocratic republic, bringing ideological hostility towards Israel ("Little Satan Title"). Iran began backing groups like Hezbollah and Hamas.
    *   **2000s onwards**: Characterised by cyber sabotage (e.g., **Stuxnet** against Natanz), targeted killings, and proxy wars in Syria, Lebanon, Iraq, and Gaza.
*   **Key Triggers of Recent Escalation (2023–2025)**
    *   Iran’s support for Hamas during and after the October 2023 Gaza conflict.
    *   **April 2024**: Iran conducted its first direct missile strike on Israeli soil, breaking precedent.
    *   **June 12, 2025**: The IAEA Board of Governors passed a resolution **censuring Iran for non-compliance with nuclear transparency**.
    *   Israel’s **“Begin Doctrine”** justifies pre-emptive strikes against potential WMD threats, cited by PM Netanyahu for the latest offensive on Iranian nuclear sites.
*   **Legal and Diplomatic Fallout**:
    *   Iran condemned the U.S. attack as a violation of international law, drawing comparisons with the 2003 Iraq Invasion based on false WMD claims.
    *   Concerns about nuclear proliferation and possible **UN Charter violations under Articles 2(4) and 51** (related to use of force and self-defence) were raised.
    *   The **Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT)**, to which Iran is a signatory, was invoked in global forums. Iran accused the U.S. of sabotaging diplomacy. Iran's parliament began drafting legislation to withdraw from the NPT, raising alarms about regional proliferation and destabilising Middle Eastern security dynamics.
    *   The IAEA confirmed damage to underground enrichment structures but reported no immediate radiation leaks.
*   **Strategic Sites Involved**:
    *   **Natanz**: Iran’s largest uranium enrichment site.
    *   **Fordow**: A highly fortified underground facility built beneath a mountain.
    *   **Isfahan**: Hosts Chinese research reactors, laboratories, and thousands of scientists.
    *   **Chabahar Port**: Key for India’s strategic access to Central Asia.
    *   **Strait of Hormuz**: Through which 25% of global oil transits, faces a blockade threat from Iran.
    *   **Leviathan Gas Field**: Off Israeli coast, a major Israeli natural gas source.
*   **Geopolitical and Strategic Implications**:
    *   **Energy Security and Global Oil Prices**: Brent crude prices rose by 11%, reaching $74.6 per barrel, and may cross $100 if the crisis worsens. Iran’s 4 million b/d crude output may reduce drastically, disrupting energy markets.
    *   **Trade Disruption and Shipping Routes**: Tensions intensify rerouting through the Cape of Good Hope, bypassing the Red Sea–Suez Canal, causing freight rate spikes and delayed shipping. LNG routes from Qatar, vital for India, are at risk.
    *   **Strategic Connectivity at Risk**: Projects like the International North-South Transport Corridor (INSTC) and the Chabahar Port—both anchored in Iran—face uncertainty, endangering India’s strategic autonomy and regional trade ambitions.
    *   **Diplomatic Tightrope for India**: India enjoys strong ties with both Israel and Iran, which could be jeopardised by a deeper conflict.
*   **Operation Sindhu (India’s Evacuation Effort)**
    *   Launched **June 23, 2025**, to evacuate Indian nationals from Iran through **Armenia**.
    *   **Armenia’s Strategic Importance**:
        *   Shares a 44-km land border with Iran, connected via the Nurduz-Agarak crossing, leading to Tehran through a 730 km highway.
        *   Offers the safest and most viable evacuation route amid volatile West Asia.
        *   **Lack of Viable Alternatives**: Pakistan (border closed due to India-Pakistan tensions after Operation Sindoor), Afghanistan (no diplomatic ties with Taliban), Turkey & Azerbaijan (strong ties with Pakistan), Iraq (conflict zone), Turkmenistan (underdeveloped border).
        *   **Robust Indo-Armenian Diplomatic Ties**: Armenia has consistently supported India at international platforms, including on Kashmir and India’s UNSC permanent seat claim. In 2022, India became Armenia’s top defence supplier (a $250 million deal including PINAKA rocket systems and Akash-1S air defence).
        *   **Connectivity and Corridor Linkages**: Armenia forms a key node in India’s International North-South Transport Corridor (INSTC).
    *   **Other Indian Evacuation Operations**: Operation Kaveri (Sudan 2023), Operation Ajay (Israel 2023), Operation Ganga (Ukraine 2022), Operation Devi Shakti (Afghanistan 2021), Operation Samudra Setu (Global 2020), Operation Raahat (Yemen 2015), Operation Safe Homecoming (Libya 2011).

*   **Bill Passed (June 20, 2025)**
    *   The U.K. House of Commons passed the **Terminally Ill Adults (End of Life) Bill**, also known as the **Assisted Dying Bill**, by a narrow margin of **314 votes to 291**.
    *   **Proposal**: To legalise assisted dying for **mentally competent, terminally ill adults in England and Wales**, with **less than six months to live**.
    *   The legislation will now move to the House of Lords for further consideration.
    *   **Sponsor**: MP **Kim Leadbeater**.
    *   **Key Features**:
        *   Patients must be over 18, of sound mental capacity, and make an informed, voluntary, and consistent request.
        *   **Multi-layered approval process**: Involves two independent doctors, a psychiatrist, a senior lawyer, and a social worker, all verifying eligibility and absence of coercion.
        *   **Free vote provision**: Allowed MPs to vote based on conscience (PM Keir Starmer supported, Opposition Leader Kemi Badenoch opposed).diagnosis risk**: Life expectancy estimates are often uncertain in terminal illnesses.
        *   **Self-coercion**: Terminally ill or disabled patients might choose death to avoid burdening family or caregivers.
        *   **Disability concerns**: MP Vicky Foxcroft stated she would not support the bill without better safeguards for disabled people.
        *   **Religious leaders** (e.g., Bishop of London) warned the legislation risks undermining protection of society’s most vulnerable.
    *   **Public Sentiment and Precedents**: In 2024, 37 Britons travelled to Switzerland’s Dignitas clinic for assisted death, cited by campaigners as a need for legal alternatives in the UK. Assisted dying enjoys broad public support in the U.K. with adequate safeguards.

        *   **Active euthanasia** (direct administration of a lethal drug) **remains illegal**.
        *   **Passive euthanasia** (withdrawal of life support) is **lawful** for competent adults via an advance directive (living will) or, if incompetent, through medical-board approval.
        *   **Supreme Court Mandate (January 2023)**: Relaxed the 2018 procedure for living wills. A living will now needs two witnesses and attestation by a notary/gazetted officer (not a Judicial Magistrate First Class - JMFC); hospital and district-stage of life as part of **Article 21**.
            *   *Aruna Shanbaug case (2011)*: Recognised passive euthanasia under strict safeguards and High-Court approval.
        *   **Law Commission Reports**: 196th Report (2006) urged legislation for doctor protection; 241st Report (2012) produced a draft Medical Treatment of Terminally-Ill Patients Bill.
